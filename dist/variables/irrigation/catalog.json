  "description": "In the ESA project Irrigation+, CNR, in collaboration with partners,\nis exploring, developing and validating advanced Earth Observation-based algorithms and techniques for\nirrigation mapping, quantification and detection of seasonal timing of irrigation from field to regional/global\nscale. The project capitalizes on the advent of the European Space Agency (ESA) Sentinel missions in synergy\nwith other data types and models. In 4DHydro the results of Irrigation+, and particularly the regional products\navailable at 1 km resolution for the Po and Ebro river basins [38, 54, 55]. Indeed, the accuracy of the irrigation\nwater product needs to be carefully checked before its use in large scale hydrological modelling. If successful,\nthe integration of Irrigation+ and 4DHydro project results will constitute a ground-breaking result both in\nterms of scientific achievements and also for the operational management of water resources",
